#  CVE-2012-5106
This is my first windows exploit.
I'm following fuzzysecurity's tutorial.
Ghidra is being used to find/analyze the bug and Immunity Debugger is being used for debugging.
For exploit development I'm starting on Windows XP Service Pack 3 with no AV enabled.
The CVE result describes the vulnerability as the following. 
"Stack-based buffer overflow in FreeFloat FTP Server 1.0 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a long string in a PUT command."
I've attempted to crash the program with PUT, but that didn't yield results.
Fuzzysecuritys MKD crashed the program.
